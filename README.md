# This is the live-demo-version
To see the original repositories where I have collaborated with my team mates Charmaine Wang and Laureta Dzika visit these links:
https://github.com/linn2punkt0/SGN-frontend
https://github.com/linn2punkt0/SGN-backend

This is only a copy of the frontend with more hard coding. All components have arrays passed to them as backup for when the fetching from Wordpress doesn't work, which it only does on my computer at the moment. So this way we can still show it on other computers.
